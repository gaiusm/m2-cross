# m2-cross
Build gcc, g++ and gm2 as cross compiler for aarch64.

This repository contains a shell script to build GNU Modula-2 as a
cross compiler and it also contains some tiny bare metal example programs
which will run on a Raspberry Pi-4.

Much of the information here can be found in other projects, the
emphasis with this repository is the ability use Modula-2 via a cross
compiler and to also show how Modula-2 can be used in a bare metal
context.
